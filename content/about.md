Originally from Florida, and born to German/Cuban immigrants, I learned to love coding and the outdoors from an early age. I attended Cornell University, where I studied Applied Economics, while working as a software engineer.

Since then, I've held roles in engineering, product, sales, marketing, and finance, in industries ranging from healthcare to cloud infrastructure, and started several startups. As one of the early members of [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com), I've had the privilege of helping grow a business to $Bs in revenue. 

Most recently, I led Go-To-Market at [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com), which was founded by [James](https://twitter.com/jamestamplin) and [Andrew](https://startupandrew.com) in 2011, and sold to Google in 2014. Firebase is now the largest app development platform in the world, used by ~15% of all developers.

I left Google in January 2019 and am now focused on consulting, angel investing, and travel, while looking for what's next. I live in San Francisco, California.
