Minimalism has always intuitively appealed to me, from stoics like Marcus Aurelius to Hippies living out of a van. At the core of minimalism is 2 concepts: 1) over time, the things we own come to own us, due to fear of losing them, 2) building our happiness on things is fragile, as things come and go. Goodbye Things is a practical guide on how to declutter your home, life, and mind.

<h2>Raw Notes</h2>

You should be happy with less
The things you own, own you
The ideal minimalist can list everything they own
To focus on the things that matter, get rid of things that don’t
Keep items that “spark joy,” when you touch them

—————-
Tips:

Just do it, and quickly
Write why you’re afraid to part with a thing
We have limited energy
Start with junk
You won’t miss anything
Start with multiples - eg 3 scissors
If you haven’t used it in a year, throw it away
If it’s for appearances, throw it away
Take pics of items that are hard to part with
Your items take up more space than you do
Get rid of storage containers
Leave unused space empty
Ditch stuff you might use “someday”
Ditch things from the past, so you can grow into the future
Discard the things you don’t know you own
Don’t rationalize reasons to keep things
Forget “getting your money’s worth;” forget what you originally paid
No need to stock up on supplies
Keep items that “spark joy,” when you touch them
Auction stuff off on eBay, it gives you one last look, and brings up nice memories
Use a pickup service to part w things easily
Stores are personal warehouses
Get out of your house
Discard items you can’t discuss w passion
“If I lost it, would I buy it again?”
Discard gifts. Nobody remembers.
Discard memorabilia, keep memories
Big items (TVs) cause many accessories
No collections; your house is no a museum
Rent what can be rented
Imagine starting from scratch. Imagine putting all your things in a storage unit, and taking out only one thing a day
Put something away for a week, before getting rid of it, so you can undo it
Discard things that create visual noise
Before you buy a thing, discard something
Don’t fall into the sunk cost fallacy
Be quick to admit mistakes; grow from them
Use things you buy temporarily, then resell
Don’t just buy something cuz it’s cheap/free
If it’s not a “hell yes,” it’s a no
The things we need will find their way back
Discarding is wasteful; keeping is even more

——————-
Advanced Tips:

Having less stuff you love is better than having lots of stuff you hate
Develop a clothes “uniform”
A little inconvenience makes you happier?
Discard it even if it “sparks joy?” Hard.
Minimalism is freedom- get there ASAP
Don’t judge others- minimalism is personal
Don’t get addicted to minimizing
Ignore the media/ads
You do less cleaning in a minimalist space
You can move out of your home in 30 mins
Being stressed = unhappiness
There is no such thing as a lazy person, we just make things too hard on ourselves
We are what we repeatedly do- excellence is not a state, but a habit
Minimalism lets you live with less ($1k/mo)
Being minimalist is giving up comparing yourself to others
Having less things gives you less silent todos

——————————
Minimize your intake of information

Minimalism is a great way to save money- Buy less, eat less due to less stress, etc

Use money for experiences, investments, etc instead of wasting it on things

Meditation

Better for the environment

Don’t look at people as objects
- Self-betrayal

Happiness is living in the moment
Happiness is not about your genetics or circumstances, but your outlook
