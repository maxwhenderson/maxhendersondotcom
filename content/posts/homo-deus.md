Mostly repetition and extension of the last chapters of Sapiens, and as a result, I found it pretty boring, despite interesting subject matter. If humans continue to progress at the current rate, we will change ourselves, or environment, and "life" completely. What happens when we can upload our consciousness into the internet? Live forever? Create super intelligent robots? Design our babies? Are we as humans ready for such a world? (NOTE: NO RAW NOTES)
