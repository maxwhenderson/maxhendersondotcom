"Work hard," "Sales cures all ills," "You only have to right once," and "No balls, no babies" are some of the pieces of advice Mark Cuban offers in this short and practical how-to guide. Lot of useful information, but none of it particuarly new/insightful - have an obsession, learn quickly, sell early, know your strengths, hire the best, and have fun. The meta-point of the book might be the most interesting: success is simple, hard work + luck.

<h2>Raw Notes</h2>

Just work hard
Get an information advantage- read 3 hours/day
Effort is the one thing in life you can control

Try a lot of things when you’re young

Debt is the ultimate dream killer

All that matters is that you get it right once; so just keep learning

Everyone has the will to win. It’s those with the will to prepare who actually DO win.

Focus. Don’t get distracted by too many opportunities. Don’t lie to yourself. 

You can’t evaluate yourself, so find others who can help you see yourself clearly. Also find people that compliment you. 

Sweat equity is the best equity.

Don’t take startup equity. Go find customers first! Doubles as a sales call.

Regret minimization framework for making decisions. 

If you love the job, the money shouldn’t matter.

Follow the path of least resistance!

If someone says no, ask for their objections, and what products they like. Handle the objections of you can, but then move on.

Figure out how to be the best at what you do.

Continuously innovate on behalf of your customers. Don’t do what they ask.
