In our experience that it is just the right amount of logic to be able to create a good static website. If you have used other template systems from different languages or frameworks you will find a lot of similarities in go templates.
This document is a brief primer on using go templates.</description>

      <description>Originally from Miami, FL, born to German/Cuban parents, I learned to code as a child. I then moved to Indiana where I double-majored in Computer Science and Electrical Engineering at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology in 2006. Subsequently, I moved to sunny California.
Together with James, Iâ€™ve started several startups. By far the most successful one was Firebase, which we started in 2011. We sold the company to Google in 2014, where we continued to work and grow the business.</description>
