    </header>

    <p>Originally from Florida, and born to German/Cuban immigrants, I learned to love coding and the outdoors from an early age. I attended Cornell University, where I studied Applied Economics, while working as a software engineer.</p>

<p>Since then, I&rsquo;ve held roles in engineering, product, sales, marketing, and finance, in industries ranging from healthcare to cloud infrastructure, and started several startups. As one of the early members of <a href="https://cloud.google.com">Google Cloud</a>, I&rsquo;ve had the privilege of helping grow a business to $Bs in revenue.</p>

<p>Most recently, I led Go-To-Market at <a href="https://firebase.google.com">Firebase</a>, which was founded by <a href="https://twitter.com/jamestamplin">James</a> and <a href="https://startupandrew.com">Andrew</a> in 2011, and sold to Google in 2014. Firebase is now the largest app development platform in the world, used by ~15% of all developers.</p>

<p>I left Google in January 2019 and am now focused on consulting, angel investing, and travel, while looking for what&rsquo;s next. I live in San Francisco, California.</p>
