<p>I didn&rsquo;t enjoy this book as much as thought I would. Phil&rsquo;s story is amazing, no doubt, but it read like one long testament to his privilege to me- he borrowed money from his rich relatives, partnered with his genius running coach, and talked to his family friend who was a CEO for advice. To his credit, he does openly acknowledge the role of luck in his success. Perhaps I would have liked it more if I was into the product (sneakers).</p>

<h2 id="raw-notes">Raw Notes</h2>

<p>Best advice: let others think you’re crazy; keep working and never give up.</p>

<p>McArthur: you are remembered for the rules you break.</p>

<p>All his success was based on who he knew.</p>

<p>The world was so small- could just fly to Japan and import goods.</p>

<p>Didn’t give up any equity in his company, even to Johnson, who made his company survive.</p>

<p>Lack of Integrity: Lied to the Japanese. Wanted Bowerman to push running shoes in his book. Spies on a supplier. Steals a folder from his Japanese supplier.</p>

<p>He was lost in thoughts with his wife. Absent-minded, misplaced things, couldn’t multitask. Crashed his car all the time. Not housebroken.</p>

<p>*** Hostile takeover. All of the hardest messages, delivered softly.</p>

<p>Such is the nature of money: whether you want it or not, it tries to define you. Your job is to never let it.</p>

<p>Students today are very smart, but very pessimistic. Trade is key to everyone’s success. There is so much opportunity today.</p>

<p>America is becoming less entrepreneurial.</p>

<p>Main regret is not being able to spend more time with family. And then, regret is not being able to do it again. Loved the ride.</p>

<p>Know when to quit. Quitting isn’t the same as stopping.</p>

<p>Luck plays a huge role. Hard work is critical, but luck decides the outcome. Have faith in yourself, but faith in faith, however you define it.</p>
